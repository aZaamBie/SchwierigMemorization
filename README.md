This is not an ordinary memorization game. It's a fun memory tester with wacky features and difficulty levels akin to a Soulslike (not yet, but will be in the future)

You can choose from a pre-made sets of words, or customize your own sets with unique words and phrases. The game has a loading and saving system, so you don't need to worry about losing your progress.
